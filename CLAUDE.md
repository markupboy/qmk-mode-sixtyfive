# Claude Code Interaction Log

This file documents the interaction between the user and Claude Code to set up Docker and GitHub Actions for building this QMK keymap.

## Initial Request

The user wanted to be able to build their QMK keymap using Docker and GitHub Actions. They clarified that they wanted the setup files created in the keymap directory itself since it's its own repository.

## Analysis Phase

Claude first explored the existing QMK repository structure and discovered:
- QMK already had Docker support with official containers (`ghcr.io/qmk/qmk_cli`)
- Existing utility scripts at `/util/docker_build.sh` and `/util/docker_cmd.sh`
- The current working directory was a specific keymap: `keyboards/mode/m256wh/keymaps/markupboy`

## Implementation

### Files Created

1. **Dockerfile**
   - Uses official QMK CLI container (`ghcr.io/qmk/qmk_cli:latest`)
   - Clones QMK firmware repository
   - Copies keymap files into correct location
   - Default command builds the specific keymap

2. **docker-compose.yml**
   - Two services: `qmk-build` for building, `qmk-shell` for interactive development
   - Volume mounts for keymap files and build output
   - Environment variables for keyboard and keymap

3. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/build-keymap.yml`)
   - Triggers on push to main/master, PRs, and manual dispatch
   - Builds firmware using Docker
   - Creates artifacts for download
   - **Release Creation**: Automatically creates GitHub releases when pushing to main branch

4. **Build Script** (`build.sh`)
   - Simple bash script for local builds
   - Handles Docker build and file copying

5. **Support Files**
   - `.dockerignore` - Excludes unnecessary files from Docker context
   - `.gitignore` - Ignores build artifacts and binaries
   - `BUILD.md` - User documentation for the Docker setup

## Key Features Implemented

### Docker Build System
- Containerized builds using official QMK tools
- Consistent environment across different machines
- No need to install QMK dependencies locally

### GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Automatic building on code changes
- Artifact downloads for each build
- **Automatic Releases**: Creates GitHub releases with firmware binaries when pushing to main

### Release Automation
- Release tags with format: `v{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}-{git-hash}`
- Release titles: "QMK mode/m256wh - markupboy {version}"
- Includes both `.bin` and `.hex` firmware files
- Detailed release notes with flashing instructions

## User Refinements

1. **Repository Scope**: User clarified that files should be created in the keymap directory since it's a separate repository
2. **Git Ignore**: User requested ignoring build folders and binaries from the repository
3. **Release Creation**: User wanted automatic releases with firmware binaries when building on main
4. **Release Title**: User requested custom release title format with keyboard/keymap info

## Technical Decisions

### Docker Strategy
- Used official QMK container instead of building custom image
- Fresh clone of QMK firmware in container ensures latest compatibility
- Volume mounting for efficient development workflow

### Build Output Handling
- Copy firmware files to mounted volume to make them accessible on host
- Multiple file format support (.bin, .hex, .uf2)

### CI/CD Strategy
- Conditional release creation (only on main branch pushes)
- Timestamped releases for clear versioning
- Comprehensive release notes for user guidance

## Testing

Claude tested the complete setup:
1. Docker build succeeded
2. Firmware compilation completed successfully
3. Output files (70,680 bytes) generated correctly
4. Docker Compose workflow validated

## Usage Commands

**Local Build:**
```bash
./build.sh                    # Simple script
docker-compose up qmk-build   # Docker Compose
```

**Development:**
```bash
docker-compose run --rm qmk-shell
```

**GitHub Actions:**
- Automatic on push to main (creates release)
- Manual trigger available
- Artifacts downloadable from Actions tab

This setup provides a complete, professional build system for QMK firmware development with modern CI/CD practices.
